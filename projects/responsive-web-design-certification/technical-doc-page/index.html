        <p>
          Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van
          Rossum, and released in 1991.
        </p>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>web development (server-side),</li>
          <li>software development,</li>
          <li>mathematics,</li>
          <li>system scripting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What can Python do?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
          <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
          <li>
            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex
            mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready
            software development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry
            Pi, etc).
          </li>
          <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
          <li>
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with
            fewer lines than some other programming languages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
            executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can
            be very quick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or
            a functional way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to
            the English language with influence from mathematics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other
            programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
            such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming
            languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Indentation">
        <header>Indentation</header>
        <p>
          Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
          Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for
          readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python
          uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >if 5 > 2:<br />
          print("Five is greater than two!")</code
        >
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command
          for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first
          assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >x = 5 <br />
          y= "John" <br />
          print(x) <br />
          print(y)</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>
          In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can store
          data of different types, and different types can do different things.
          Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these
          categories:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Text Type: str</li>
          <li>Numeric Types: int, float, complex</li>
          <li>Sequence Types: list, tuple, range</li>
          <li>Mapping Type: dict</li>
          <li>Set Types: set, frozenset</li>
          <li>Boolean Type: bool</li>
          <li>Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Conditions_and_If_statements">
        <header>Conditions and If statements</header>
        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Equals: a == b</li>
          <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
          <li>Less than: a < b</li>
          <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
          <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
          <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if
          statements" and loops.
        </p>
        <h3>If, Else and Elif</h3>
        <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
        <p>
          The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions
          were not true, then try this condition".
        </p>
        <p>
          The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding
          conditions.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >a = 200<br />
          b = 33<br />
          if b > a:<br />
          print("b is greater than a")<br />
          elif a == b:<br />
          print("a and b are equal")<br />
          else:<br />
          print("a is greater than b")</code
        >
        <p>
          In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not
          true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else
          condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
        </p>
        <p>You can also have an else without the elif:</p>
        <code
          >a = 200<br />
          b = 33<br />
          if b > a:<br />
          print("b is greater than a")<br />
          else:<br />
          print("b is not greater than a")</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>while loops</li>
          <li>for loops</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a
          condition is true.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >i = 1<br />
          while i < 6:<br />
          print(i)<br />
          i += 1</code
        >
        <p>
          A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a
          list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like
          the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an
          iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming
          languages. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once
          for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br />
          for x in fruits:<br />
          print(x)</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
          can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
          return data as a result.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a Function</h3>
        <p>
          In Python a function is defined using the <code>def</code> keyword:
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >def my_function(): <br />
          print("Hello from a function")</code
        >
        <h3>Calling a Function</h3>
        <p>
          To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >def my_function(): <br />
          print("Hello from a function") <br />

          my_function()</code
        >
        <h3>Arguments</h3>
        <p>
          Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are
          specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add
          as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma. The
          following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the
          function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside
          the function to print the full name:
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <code
          >def my_function(fname): <br />
          print(fname + " Refsnes") <br />

          my_function("Emil") <br />
          my_function("Tobias") <br />
          my_function("Linus")</code
        >
